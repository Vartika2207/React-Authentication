We can used react-context, but we can also use react route which wraps all routes.
We added loader which takes localStorage and then token would be available through loader data in all other routes.
Created tokenLoader in auth.js file and added in App.js in root loader which will be called whenever a new navigation action occurs for eg. when triggered logout.
Now we always checks current status of token whenever user does anything on page, submits or navigate around and ensures it always have lastest info about token.

Now this root-token can be used anywhere.
Using token in MainNavigation.js and fetching it using useRouteLoaderData hook having id as 'root'.
Based on presence of session token, login logout are displayed or hidden in MainNavigation.js

Doing similar process in EventsNavigation.js for New events which will be shown if token prosent.

Doing similar proces in EventItems.js
