the time is set to 1 hr again.
Hence added expiration date logic in pages>Authentication.js with the time when we first got token

In auth.js in getAuthToken() checked using expiration date bu adding a function getTokenDuration() to check remaining time.
Updated token duration logic in Root.js

Removed expiration from localStorage in Logout.js
